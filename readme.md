# Cameo Models

All parts for both the first and final Cameo prototypes can be downloaded here. 

## 3D Printing
- To print Cameo’s base, ensure your 3D printer has a minimum build volume of **256 × 256 mm**.  
- When slicing, it is recommended to use an infill of at least **20%** to maintain sufficient strength.
- For some models with unusual (very large) sizes, simply scale them to **10%** for printing in slicing or CAD.

## Assembly Instructions
- Follow the structure in the model files to assemble all components correctly.  
- When installing the servo motors, use a controller to adjust their positions beforehand.  
- It is recommended to set each servo at **0°** or **180°** (the minimum or maximum position) for accurate alignment before final installation.
